# One-Click Spider Solitaire

This is a free, web-based, no-ad version based on some of the same code as my One-click FreeCell. 

# What's New

* Version 1.27 - use emoji that work on Android 4.4
* Version 1.24 - bug fix to kings don't stack on top of aces of the next suit
* Version 1.2 - allow the game to start from clicking the "deal" deck
* Version 1.1 - improve intelligence to prioritize same-suit stacking
* Version 1.0 - all is working - a real release

# To Do List

* Refactor for cleaner variable names, like !nmove should be canMove
* Functional coding for the dealing timing? Like slowly(deal())?
* Nicer looking css for buttons? Have buttons disappear when not relevant?
